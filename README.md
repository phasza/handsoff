# handsoff

No more tiny little hands fiddling with my keyboard!

## What's this?

A small app for macOS, which disables the keyboard input on command. Unfortunately I did not find a way to disable also the trackpad yet. It's a start.

## Usage

> > Needs accessibility permission on system settings.

1. cmd + L: toggle keyboard lock
2. cmd + Q: exit application
   also see the menu on the status bar
